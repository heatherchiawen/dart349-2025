    <h3>Design</h3>
    <p>UIn this 3D world, users are taken through an immersive experience coupled with ambient sound. The imagery references its creator's expertise as a web developer throughout the laid-out environment.</p>

    <h3>Usability</h3>
    <p>Aspects of the website portfolio are highlighted with headings and when hovered over its situated space, light up and produce a distinct selection sound reminiscent of video games creating a straightforward and intuitive user experience.</p>

    <h3>Content</h3>
    <p>While the content alone clearly emphasizes that the website is a personal portfolio, the visual elements personify the website.</p>

    <h3>Creativity</h3>
    <p>The 3D animated technology such as data centres and satellites embodies a creative approach and relevancy to the creatorâ€™s professional experience while abstractly connecting to its headings.</p>
