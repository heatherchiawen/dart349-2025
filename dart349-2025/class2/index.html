    <h3>Design</h3>
    <p>The website consistently references retro technology on its loading screen, main page, and sub-pages, planting subtle clues regarding its purpose. The site only expands on these clues when the user hovers or clicks with their cursor. </p>

    <h3>Usability</h3>
    <p>While the main menu box is condensed at first glance, its sub-headings seem less clear than the numbered statistics it aims to emphasize. Hovering on these sub-headings shows numbered pages and links, however, seemingly unintuitively ordered.</p>

    <h3>Content</h3>
    <p>Considering that the website seems intended for the company's Black Friday and Cyber Monday analytics, its visual approach offers a fun way to examine data.</p>

    <h3>Creativity</h3>
    <p>Despite the lack of intuition on the user end, the site's approach to organizing information in a photo-realistic setting poses an interesting way to view information in more analog scenarios.</p>
